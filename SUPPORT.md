## Installation or setup

Use the **Installation / setup problem** issue form.

Include:

- AFK AI version, tag, or commit
- installer phase or last status shown
- exact error text
- whether Windows requested a restart
- whether Docker Desktop opens successfully
- Windows version
- GPU model when relevant
- a sanitised diagnostic report when available

Do not post credentials, `.env` contents, private documents, chats, prompts, cookies, tokens, or unrelated machine information.

## Hardware or compatibility

Use the **Hardware / compatibility problem** form for issues involving:

- GPU or CPU support
- memory or disk pressure
- Windows version
- hardware virtualization
- WSL
- Docker compatibility

Include what AFK AI detected and what Windows, WSL, Docker, or Ollama reported.

## Product bugs

Use the **General bug** form for a reproducible problem after setup, including:

- chat or Open WebUI
- start and stop behaviour
- service health
- model selection
- Control Center behaviour
- search or local voice
- behaviour that disagrees with the documentation

## Security and privacy

Do not publish sensitive security details in a normal issue.

Use the private reporting path in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Writing a useful report

Keep the report focused on one reproducible problem. Include the evidence needed to reproduce it and remove unrelated machine details before posting.
