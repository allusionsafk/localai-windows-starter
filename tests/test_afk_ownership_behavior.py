"""Uninstalling AFK LocalAI must only ever stop what it can prove it owns.

The defect these cover: the uninstaller used to run ``py -m localai stop``,

the private engineering workbench installed editable that unloaded every loaded
Ollama model, tore down the workbench's compose project, and force-closed
Docker Desktop and Ollama for the whole machine.
